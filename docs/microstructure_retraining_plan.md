# Microstructure Feature Retraining Plan

## Overview

To leverage newly engineered market microstructure signals—such as order imbalance,
volume delta, and related order-flow metrics—the classifier must be retrained.
Adding features to the live trading pipeline without updating the model leaves the
existing coefficients or tree structures unaware of how to use the new inputs. This
plan outlines how to collect the required data, retrain, and validate the enhanced
model.

## Data Collection

1. Begin recording the microstructure fields in live or paper trading immediately.
2. Build a historical dataset that includes both the existing features and the new
   microstructure signals.
3. Ensure timestamps and symbols align with the current feature set to keep the
   training data consistent.

## Model Retraining

1. Once the dataset contains a meaningful history with the added features, retrain the
   classifier using the expanded feature matrix.
2. Update preprocessing pipelines so the new inputs are normalized, clipped, or
   otherwise transformed in the same way during both training and inference.
3. Store versioned artifacts for the retrained model, preprocessing steps, and feature
   metadata to support reproducibility.

## Evaluation Strategy

1. Use cross-validation or a walk-forward (forward-testing) split on the most recent
   market periods to quantify performance changes.
2. Track metrics such as prediction accuracy, Sharpe ratio, and profit factor to verify
   that the microstructure features add value.
3. Compare signal confidence before and after retraining; microstructure-aware models
   should exhibit higher conviction when strong order-flow support aligns with other
   indicators.

## Deployment Considerations

1. Roll out the retrained model to paper trading first to validate behaviour in a live
   environment without risk.
2. Monitor feature availability, inference latency, and prediction drift to ensure the
   production system consumes the new inputs correctly.
3. Promote the model to live trading once stability and performance improvements are
   confirmed.

Following this process ensures that the trading system fully exploits the predictive
power of microstructure signals while maintaining disciplined model governance.
